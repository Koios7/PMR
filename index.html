			<b>Introduction</b></br>
			The Poor Man's Ruby will be a turn based fantasy survival game that focuses on critical decision making. The game will utilize 2.5d sprites with animations, tiled and sparse backgrounds, intelligent and formidable AI, efficient memory management, render threading, as well as other basic techniques.</br>
			</br>
			
			<b>Technology</b></br>
			The Poor Man's Ruby will be developed using the libgdx Java library with portability in mind. Libgdx has built in libraries for handling music, sound effects, rendering, and sprite management. The application for sprite creation has not yet been decided.</br>
			</br>
			
			<b>Basic Concept</b></br>
			The Poor Man's Ruby provides players with high replay value by randomly generating its map for each playthrough and populating it with randomized events. Further playthroughs are encouraged by unlocking achievements and additional starting parties. Combat is handled by a turn based strategy system.</br>
			</br>
				
			<b>Backstory</b></br>
			The Divine Legion is coming, and no one can stand in their way. You have stolen the Compendium, a relic of incredible knowledge and power. Someone may be able to unlock its secrets to drive back The Divine Legion, if you can only escape their clutches!</br>
			</br>
			
			<b>Objective</b></br>
			The objective of the player is to traverse the world map, encountering randomized events while building up their partyâ€™s strength for their final confrontation with The Divine Legionâ€™s forces that have been chasing them. The Divine Legion can be confronted whenever the player wishes to engage them, though the most opportune time to do so is left to the playerâ€™s discretion.</br>
			</br>

			<b>Gameplay</b></br>
			The player must progress along the world map to their destination while evading the advancing forces of The Divine Legion. As they travel, they encounter random events that determine the course their game will take, from gaining allies, supplies, and experience, to combat scenarios where valued party members may unfortunately perish.</br>
			</br>
			Every character has their own stats generated by a standard distribution which determine the actions they can take, both in responding to events and in combat. These are divided into two categories- physical stats, such as strength and constitution, and psychological stats, such as honor and sanity. Unlike most games, where character growth is tied to levelling up, experience directly enhances innate physical stats, and in the process can unlock new abilities and skills.</br>
			</br>
			There are six different species of playable characters that each have their own attributes and special abilities. Humans are used as a standard of measure but are by no means average- for example they are on average the most innately intelligent species that occurs in the game. The five remaining playable species are original to The Poor Manâ€™s Ruby. Bulwarks are a fiercely territorial agrarian species who are primarily antagonized by Slavers, a predatory species that relies on raiding. Graveworms are a parasitoid with incredible mental potential that are largely encountered in events, where they often lie and attempt to trick the player. When controlled by the player, Graveworms have the macabre ability to consume enemies to gain some of their experience. Skulks are generally only encountered during night events as enemies, but it is possible to recruit them as allies. Garnets are the ultimate fighter and swing the course of events heavily. They are only accessible through use of the Compendium, and are often necessary in defeating The Divine Legionâ€™s forces.</br>
			</br>
			Starting parties have locked stats and skills to prevent restarting many times to achieve an advantage as well as to encourage specific playstyles. Initially the player only has one starting party available to them composed entirely of Humans, but may unlock other starting parties that potentially have characters of different races or specializations.</br>
			</br>
			The events the player encounters are varied, and have many possible courses of action for the player to pursue depending on their party, stats, skills, equipment, and so on. This involves a detailed decision tree with weighted random components to provide enhanced replayability. An event may be encountered multiple times and the same decision may produce different results.</br>
			</br>
			Combat utilizes a turn based system where the sequence of characters turns may change dynamically. The playerâ€™s characters have several options during their turn- they can move along a path to a destination and can choose which action theyâ€™d like to perform. Actions include attacking or performing a special ability. At the conclusion of a turn, they choose a direction to face.</br>
			</br>
			Equipment is divided into several categories. There are axes and clubs, bows, polearms, swords, shields, artifacts and relics, and various armors. Characters will gain experience in each category through training, and to a lesser extent, usage.</br>
			</br>
			In between events, characters may each perform a single action such as training each other or using one of their skill. For example, two characters may train each other in swordsmanship to increase the experience levels associated with the skill. Characters may also use skills such as smithing to improve or repair equipment.</br>
			</br>
			<b>Controls</b></br>
			Since the game is being designed with portability in mind, the controls will be focused around the mouse. Hotkeys for actions will also be provided as auxiliary aids.</br>
			</br>
			World Map</br>
			Left Click: Select the next destination to travel to.</br>
			</br>
			Events</br>
			Left Click: Select an appropriate reaction from the provided list.</br>
			</br>
			Combat</br>
			Left Click: Select unitsâ€™ actions, movement destinations, targets, etc.</br>
			</br>

			<b>Graphical User Interface</b></br>
			For the GUI, we must consider the following:</br>
			</br>
			Game Start Menu</br>
			This GUI should appear when the game is loaded. It will have a game logo and a number of menu options:</br>
			New Game: After selecting a difficulty level and starting party, this allows the user to start a new game. Instructions will be provided at the start of the playthrough.</br>
			Continue: Allows the user to resume a playthrough currently in progress.</br>
			Stats: Allows the user to view statistics for past playthroughs, and any achievements they have unlocked.</br>
			Settings: This will display a screen that will allow the player to adjust options such as audio levels.</br>
			Credits: This button will display a screen containing brief information on the gameâ€™s creators.</br>
			Quit Game: This button will exit the game.</br>
			</br>
			In-Game Menu </br>
			This menu will be accessible at any point while the game is in progress: </br>
			Save Game: If selected, the userâ€™s current game data will be saved and preserved until he resumes the game from the main menu. The game will then exit to the main menu.</br>
			Return to Main Menu: If selected, the game will ask to ensure the user wishes to exit the game. If confirmed, the game will exit to the main (game start) menu. No data will be saved at the time.</br>
			</br>
			In-game GUI </br>
			This GUI will provide some basic, context sensitive buttons.</br>
			</br>
			World Map</br>
			On the world map, each destination will appear as a clickable button.</br>
			</br>
			Events</br>
			Events will be simple dialogue boxes with multiple reactions that the player can select from using the mouse or hotkeys, if available.</br>
			</br>
			Combat</br>
			Within combat, player and enemy units will move sequentially; information about the current unit will be displayed during its turn. On a player unitâ€™s turn, they can select a path to move along, select an action from those available to the unit, a target from those within range of the unitâ€™s abilities, and a direction to face upon completion of their turn.</br>
			</br>
			<b>Artwork</b></br>
			All artwork in the game will be original. The following will need to be created:</br>
			</br>
			Units </br>
			Each unit will have a specified race and equipment chosen by the player. This will require animations for:</br>
			Moving horizontally</br>
			Moving vertically</br>
			Attacking (with each type of weapon)</br>
			Taking damage</br>
			Dying</br>
			Using abilities (if necessary)</br>
			Since combat takes place on a hex grid, this will necessitate animations for all six perspectives.</br>
			</br>
			Environments</br>
			Different events will take place in different environments, necessitating a variety of images with which to construct them.</br>
			</br>
			Backgrounds</br>
			During world map selections and event selections and combat, there will be background images displayed. The style and appearance of such backgrounds may vary depending on the context.</br>
			</br>
			<b>Sound Effects</b></br>
			All sound effects will be original. Sounds must be created to tailor to the following needs:</br>
			Attacking</br>
			Defending</br>
			Taking damage</br>
			Unit death</br>
			Indicator for approaching a boss battle</br>
			Victory</br>
			Game Over</br>
			Miscellaneous combat actions</br>
			</br>
			<b>Music</b></br>
			Original music will be composed to fit the gameâ€™s needs, and will match both the medieval fantasy setting of the game and the context of the situation. The required tracks will include:</br>
			Title music</br>
			Menu music</br>
			Combat music (different tracks depending on the opponents)</br>
			World map music</br>
			Event screen music (World map music may be reused here)</br>
